# Interview Test - Accessible Form Handling & Validation
To run the test, do one of the following:

## 1. Install and run project dependencies
- Node 16 is required as a minimum - see https://nodejs.org/en/download.
- Run `npm install --global yarn` - installs Yarn if you don't already have it.
- Run `yarn start` - installs project dependencies, starts Parcel dev server, and launches the website at http://localhost:4321/.

## 2. View static version of BUILD output
> - No need to run the commands above.
> - The Parcel bundler generated `build` output has been copied to the `STATIC_BUILD` folder.
> - `index.html` has been edited to fix CSS/JS relative file paths, and `type="module"` has been removed from the script bundle to resolve CORS error when trying to execute JS locally from the file system.
- Remove the `.txt` suffix from JS file.
- Open `STATIC_BUILD/index.html` in a browser.
